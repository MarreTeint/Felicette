# Felicette
Galaxy simulation project carried out at Polytech Paris Saclay
## Objective
Use OpenGL & SDL2 to realize a 3d simulation with a 2 week deadline.

For this project, we had chosen to model the solar system.
The different positions of the planets and the sun are calculated from the gravity forces between the different celestial bodies.
## Controls
- Camera
  - Move with LMB+Move the mouse
  - Center the camera on the next body Tab
  - Zoom & Unzoom by scrolling
## Defects & possible improvements
- Saturn does not have its rings
- The background of the image creates black parts if we zoom too much on a body
- Possible scaling defects
- No possibility to accelerate time
- No display of body name when camera is centered on a body
- No moons
